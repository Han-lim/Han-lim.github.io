이번에 리뷰할 PETR 라는 논문은 2022년도 ECCV에서 발표된 논문입니다. <br>

<u>BEVFormer의 key design은 다음과 같습니다.</u> <br>
1) Grid-shaped BEV queries to fuse spatial and temporal features via attention mechanisms flexibly <br>
2) Spatial cross-attention module to aggregate the spatial features from multi-camera images <br>
3) Temporal self-attention module to extract temporal information from history BEV features, which benefits the velocity estimation of moving objects and the detection of heavily occluded objects. <br>
